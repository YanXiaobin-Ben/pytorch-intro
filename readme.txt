This is just a couple of simple scripts to illustrate how to use PyTorch. There are two examples:

1) Convolutional residual network (bottleneck variant) inspired by [R1] -- We use CIFAR-10 to train/test.

2) LSTM-based word language model inspired by [R2] -- We use a custom-processed version of the Penn Treebank data set.
